- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JamesDorling.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming and testing, and I like playing video games.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java with Sparta Global.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me via my portfolio contact form: https://jamesdorling.myportfolio.com/

This GitHub is intended to be an extension of my portfolio, where some of the projects I have shown can be accessed on a deeper level by people looking to see how I code.
